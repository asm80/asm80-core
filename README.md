# asm80-core
Core assembler as ES6 module

Currently I am converting codebase from 2010's form to modern. Please be patient. [Support my effort to rewrite and open the source code](https://donate.stripe.com/7sI8yU7jCbzp4wMeUX)

## Alpha stage

!!! Use on your own risk !!!

It works, but not documented yet and the API is not settled yet. [NPM is available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@asm80/core)

## about ASM80

ASM80.com is a cutting-edge online development environment for 8-bit microprocessors, providing developers and hobbyists a simple and user-friendly way to create, code, and interact with their retro computing projects. Over the 10 years, I've worked hard to improve and maintain this unique platform, but now, it's time for a change.

The technology landscape and best practices have evolved exponentially since the inception of our platform. In order to keep up with these advancements, I must dedicate the time and resources needed to bring our beloved development environment into the modern age. My vision involves overhauling the entire platform, implementing modern technologies, simplifying our expansion, and most importantly, making it available as an open-source project for everyone to use, collaborate, and contribute.

The challenge: This mammoth task cannot be accomplished in the little spare time I have outside my full-time job. To make this vision a reality, I need funding support so I can fully commit and focus on recreating our 8-bit microprocessor development environment to its full potential.

By supporting my effort, you'll help breathe new life into our development platform, benefiting 8-bit microprocessor enthusiasts all around the globe. By doing so, you'll also play your part in expanding the open-source movement, championing collaboration and innovation across the tech industry.

Your contributions will go towards:

- Development costs: Funding will enable me to focus fully on this project and pay for hosting, database, ads etc.
- Increased collaboration: Opening our platform as open-source will enable a wealth of like-minded developers to contribute their expertise and innovations.
- Time: Your generous contributions will allow me to allocate the necessary time and energy required to oversee and direct this major undertaking, ensuring top quality and efficiency every step of the way.
